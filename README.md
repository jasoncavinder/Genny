# Genny

Genny is (becoming) a character generator for multiple tabletop-roleplaying-games. I am developing it for the final project for my Bachelor's Degree in programming, but intend to develop it more fully after graduation.

### Roadmap

Mobile TRGP Character Generator (My "IT - Software" Capstone Project @ WGU)

#### Short-term planned features:

- [x] Mobile app for iOS
- [x] Mobile app for Android
- [ ] Mobile app for Windows Phone¹
- [x] "Dice Bag"
- [ ] Generates full characters
- [ ] Produces and prints a character sheet
- [ ] Level Advancement
- [ ] "Quick" or "One-Click" character creation
- [x] Name list/generator

#### Long-term planned features:

- [ ] Describe and publish the GSD standard²
- [ ] Describe and publish the CSD standard²
- [ ] Describe and publish the CDF standard²
- [ ] Plug-in system for additional GSDs - Validates and loads custom GSDs¹
- [ ] At least two games systems (GSDs) included/available¹
- [ ] At least one character sheet per game system as CSD/PDF-F bundle¹

¹ *I don't have a Windows phone to test on; let me know if you do.*

² *GSD, CSD, and CDF are planned as part of Genny's Sister project, [OGRE](https://github.com/jasoncavinder/OGRE) (Open Gaming Regulae Editicia).*

>  ##### 'Fun Fact'
>
>  Coincidentally, the name for this app, "Genny" as in "generator", was coined just before Jason was cast as Sir Guilliam in a production of Camelot; featuring King Arthur, Wart; Sir Lancelot du Lac, Lance; and Queen Guinevere, Genny!


```
```

### Current version (v0.1.0)
This current release is no more than a functioning app, with a "Dice Bag". Feel free to use it as such for now, though it is primarily intended for my friends to follow my development and give feedback.
