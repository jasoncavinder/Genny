# Genny

Genny is (becoming) a character generator for multiple tabletop-roleplaying-games. I am developing it for the final project for my Bachelor's Degree in programming, but intend to develop it more fully after graduation.

>  #### 'Fun Fact'
>
>  Coincidentally, the name for this app, "Genny" as in "generator", was coined just before Jason was cast as Sir Guilliam in a production of Camelot; featuring King Arthur, Wart; Sir Lancelot du Lac, Lance; and Queen Guinevere, Genny!


## Changelog

Coming soon...

### Current version (v0.1.0)
This current release is no more than a functioning app, with a "Dice Bag". Feel free to use it as such for now, though it is primarily intended for my friends to follow my development and give feedback.
